        <h3>This a timeline of some dummy text because why not? Lol</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><b>1900</b> - Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet</li>
          <li>
            <b>1991</b> - Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this girl
            with a hand on his chest. They floated in the puppet place had been
            a subunit of Freeside’s security system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1995</b> - The Tessier-Ashpool ice shattered, peeling away from
            the Chinese program’s thrust, a worrying impression of solid
            fluidity, as though the shards of a broken mirror bent and elongated
            as they rotated, but it never told the correct time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1997</b> - No light but the muted purring of the blowers and the
            amplified breathing of the fighters.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1998</b> - The semiotics of the bright void beyond the chain
            link. Case had never seen him wear the same suit twice, although his
            wardrobe seemed to consist entirely of meticulous reconstruction’s
            of garments of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM cassette
            replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1999</b> - Its hands were holograms that altered to match the
            convolutions of the console in faded pinks and yellows.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>2000</b> - Its hands were holograms that altered to match the
            convolutions of the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim
            figures moving toward him in the dark.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>2002</b> - No light but the muted purring of the blowers and the
            amplified breathing of the fighters.
